Each arrow must correspond to a different coordinate.

Magic Labyrinth Sequence Snake: There is a single, non-branching, 1-cell wide, orthogonally-connected 'snake' in the grid. The snake may not touch itself orthogonally or diagonally.

The snake contains a potentially repeating sequence of three distinct digits, to be determined by the solver, called the Magic Labyrinth Sequence (MLS). The head of the snake is located below its tail. The MLS must appear in numerically increasing order from head to tail. For example, if the MLS is {2, 4, 6}, the ordered contents of the the snake could be: (head) 2 4 6 2 4 6 (tail).

However, Digits not included in the MLS can appear anywhere along the snake. So the ML sequence doesn't need to start or end exactly at the head or tail. For example, another valid snake, using the same MLS of {2, 4, 6}, could be: (head) 5 3 2 4 6 5 1 2 5 1 4 1 6 1 (tail).

Non-consecutive dots: Digits in cells separated by red dots must be non-consecutive. Additionally, the snake must visit exactly one of the cells separated by red dots.

Killer Cages: Digits in cages cannot repeat (though values can). Values within a cage sum to the clue in the top left. A killer cage must contain an equal number of black and white holes, but that number may be zero.

Teleporting Little Killer: The clue outside the grid with an arrow is a teleporting little killer. It indicates that the sum of digits along a diagonally travelling path starting in the cell pointed at by the arrow is greater than zero. This path only ends when it reaches an edge of the grid. When the path enters a black hole cell it teleports to the white hole cell with the same digit maintaining the direction of travel of the original path and including the value of both holes in its sum.
