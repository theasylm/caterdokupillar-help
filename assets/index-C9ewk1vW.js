Teleporting Little Killer: The clue outside the grid with an arrow is a teleporting little killer. It indicates that the sum of digits along a diagonally travelling path starting in the cell pointed at by the arrow is greater than zero. This path only ends when it reaches an edge of the grid. When the path enters a black hole cell it teleports to the white hole cell with the same digit maintaining the direction of travel of the original path and including the value of both holes in its sum. The path must visit the same number of black and white holes, but that number may be zero.
